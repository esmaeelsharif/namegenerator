So I've spent way too much time trying to find the perfect business name lately (probably like most of you here). After burning through dozens of mediocre suggestions and losing a few good domains to other people, I decided to actually test the popular name generators systematically.
Here's what I found after trying pretty much everything out there:
1. NameGator.net - The domain checker champion
This one surprised me honestly. I wasn't expecting much, but NameGator.net turned out to be incredibly useful for one key reason - it checks domain availability across 30+ TLDs instantly. No more clicking through 15 different tabs to see if your idea is taken.
The AI suggestions aren't groundbreaking, but they're solid. What really sold me was how fast it works. You type something in, and boom - you immediately know if .com, .net, .io, .co, and bunch of others are available. Saved me probably hours of manual checking.
Quick tip: Try mixing your main keyword with action words like "hub," "forge," or "lab" - works surprisingly well
2. Namelix - Pretty smart AI, actually
Namelix has this interesting approach where it learns from your preferences. You pick names you like, it gets better at suggesting similar ones. The machine learning thing actually seems to work here (not just marketing fluff).
Best feature? It shows you logo mockups alongside the names. Helps you visualize how the brand might look, which honestly makes a difference when you're trying to decide.
Downside: Sometimes generates names that sound a bit too "startup-y" if you know what I mean. Like everything ends up sounding like a tech company even if that's not what you're going for.
3. Name Mesh - Great for brainstorming
Name Mesh takes your keywords and creates different categories - Common, New, Short, etc. It's not the most sophisticated tool, but man is it good for getting your creative juices flowing.
I like using it when I'm completely stuck. Just throw in your main concept and see what comes up in the different categories. Often finds combinations I wouldn't have thought of.
The interface is pretty basic (looks like it's from 2010 tbh), but it gets the job done.
4. BizNameWiz - Solid all-arounder
BizNameWiz doesn't do anything revolutionary, but it's reliable. Good mix of creative suggestions without getting too weird. I've actually seen several successful businesses using names that came from here.
What I appreciate is that it gives context for why certain names might work. Not just random word combinations - there's some logic behind the suggestions.
5. Namify.tech - The technical favorite
Namify.tech is probably the most comprehensive one I tested. Checks social media handles, suggests logos, even gives you brandability scores. If you want everything in one place, this is it.
The AI here feels more advanced than most others. Understands context better and generates names that actually make sense for your industry.
Only complaint: Can be overwhelming with all the features. Sometimes you just want a simple name suggestion, not a full brand analysis.
What I learned from all this testing

Always check domains first - Nothing worse than falling in love with a name only to find out the .com was taken 5 years ago
Don't rely on just one tool - Each generator has its own "personality" and blind spots
Say the name out loud - Seriously, if it's hard to pronounce or sounds weird, people won't remember it
Test it with friends - What sounds clever to you might be confusing to everyone else

Anyone else have experience with these tools? What worked (or didn't work) for you?
